## Solution 
Main screen (Departures) is implemented based on MVVM architecture.
The network layer is implemented based on Operations. And in the future, it allows adding new endpoints very quickly.
Only utils libraries were used as third-party dependencies.

## Issues
Issues were related to the empty responses that I was getting for a long time and I cannot test data parsing.
Didn't test pagination as I cannot get enough departures.

## Deltas
* Support dark mode;
* Write unit-tests.

## Requirements
- iOS 14 or later
- A Mac with Xcode 12 or later

Hey! 

It will be hot this summer in Montreal with the [Osheaga festival](http://www.osheaga.com/)! 
Assuming we're not stuck with another wave of COVID-19, it will also be a rocking festival!
Your challenge is to build a promotional app that allows a traveler from NYC to find one-way departure schedules for the festival's opening weekend.

### Requirements

Write a native Busbud app that:

- Has a simple onboarding screen that will open the search
- Lists all the departures for a given origin city (**New York - geohash: dr5reg**) and a given destination city (**Montréal - geohash: f25dvk**) for a given day (**the 29th of July 2021**) for **1** adult. 
For each item, we want, at least, to see the **departure time**, the **arrival time**, the **location name** and the **price** (use `prices.total` of the `departure`).

### Non-functional requirements

- Challenge is submitted as pull request against this repo ([fork it](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)).
- The repo should include 3 screenshots under the /screenshots folder to show the app usage.
- Change the README.md to explain your solution, the issues, the way you solved them...

### Supporting API

In order to complete this challenge, you will be making requests to `napi.busbud.com`, Busbud's production API.  
For all requests, you MUST provide the following HTTP headers:

Header | Value
--- | ---
Accept | `application/vnd.busbud+json; version=2; profile=https://schema.busbud.com/v2/`
X-Busbud-Token | The token provided in the challenge invitation email.

### Init results

To get departure results, search is initialized via the following endpoint:

`https://napi.busbud.com/x-departures/:origin/:destination/:outbound_date`

PATH PARAMS  

`origin` : Origin's geohash
`destination` : Destination's geohash
`outbound_date` : Outbound departure date

QUERY PARAMS:

`adult` : Number of adults
`child` : Number of children
`senior` : Number of seniors
`lang` : ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 language code
`currency` : ISO 4217 currency code

The response looks like:
```
{
  "origin_city_id": "375dd5879001acbd84a4683dedf9eed1",

### Poll results

**While "complete" is false, you need to call** :

`https://napi.busbud.com/x-departures/:origin/:destination/:outbound_date/poll`

With ***all*** the same parameters that the previous endpoint, plus:

`index` : Index from which to return new departures

The response is:
```
{
  "departures": [
    { XDeparture },
    { XDeparture }
  ],
  "operators": [
    { Operator },
    { Operator }
  ],
  "complete": true,
  "ttl": 900
}
```
