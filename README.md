## Challenge Notes

### Architecture
- Although I feel more comfortable with MVP, decided to use MVVM with the architecture components provided by the Android platform to trial out some of its latest features.
- Did not implement UseCase/Interactor and directly injected the repository on the ViewModel. If I invested more time and/or added more features, the logic for the caching of the response and the "complete" logic to continue to poll results would probably be wrapped in a UseCase/Interactor. In the end I felt that the ViewModel got a bit more bloated than I would like to.
- Decided not to use Fragments, as they were not needed for the sake of the challenge. If we were to support tablet with list->detail, I would probably encapsulate the SearchActivity within a Fragment.

### Dependency Injection
- Decided to try a alpha library, which is [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android), and got pretty happy with the choice. Seems to release the developer from some of the work needed for the initial Dagger configuration for a new project.
- Unfortunately, due to time restrictions ended up not taking advantage of one of the nicest features for me, which is the easier way of uninstalling and installing a module on the dependency graph for the UI/Integration tests.

### Functionality
- Initial screen is a simple screen with a small information text.
- Once you click on Find Bus button you will be moved to the Search page with the predefined data from the Challenge
- Since the API was returning 0 results for 29th July 2021, I have added the capability for the user to switch the dates (by pressing on the TextView, not a beautiful UI experience I know, but the addition of dynamic choosing the dates was a late call)
- Also provided the ability to change Currency. For that included an existing library (not done by me). If I was building this for my product, I would probably create a specific currency selector, with currencies supported by the API.
- Error handling is kind of limited. Only sends an error, but does not do any specific parsing. So every error will lead to the same error message.

### Network
- For network I've used [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)
- For json serialization I've decided to try out as part of this challenge [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi)
- Only parsed fields that I felt could be relevant for the challenge.

### Asynchronous Tasks
- Although Google team recently announced that Coroutines are the new recommended way of doing asynchronous work, I've decided to go with [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava), as I feel more comfortable with it at this point.

### UI Tests
- Did only a small example, so you understand how I think about UI tests. Usually I like to use the Robot Pattern for them. With more time I would have covered the SearchActivity also with UI tests.

### Other Notes
- Did not worried too much with Timezones. With more time would do a bit more extensive work around TimeZones to improve the implementation (as they are always tricky..)
- UI is not amazing, as I decided not to waste too much time on it, for the sake of the challenge. If aiming to deliver to production, I would rethink some of the UI choices.
- Color structuring are ready to Dark Mode, but I did not validate that the colors would work good in the Dark Mode.
- Text Appearance should be stylized (so we would have a set of predefined styles), but for this purpose they are defined ad-hoc per screen.
- For the sake of the challenge, did not considered the language of the device. I am always calling the API without the "lang" query parameter, but could easily adapt to use device language to define that query parameter.

Hey! 

It will be hot this summer in Montreal with the [Osheaga festival](http://www.osheaga.com/)! 
Assuming we're not stuck with another wave of COVID-19, it will also be a rocking festival!
Your challenge is to build a promotional app that allows a traveler from Quebec City to find one-way departure schedules for the festival's opening weekend.

### Requirements

Write a native Busbud app that:

- Has a simple onboarding screen that will open the search
- Lists all the departures for a given origin city (**Quebec - geohash: f2m673**) and a given destination city (**Montreal - geohash: f25dvk**) for a given day (**the 29th of July 2021**) for **1** adult. 
For each item, we want, at least, to see the **departure time**, the **arrival time**, the **location name** and the **price** (use `prices.total` of the `departure`).

### Non-functional requirements

- Challenge is submitted as pull request against this repo ([fork it](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)).
- The repo should include 3 screenshots under the /screenshots folder to show the app usage.
- Change the README.md to explain your solution, the issues, the way you solved them...

### Supporting API

In order to complete this challenge, you will be making requests to `napi.busbud.com`, Busbud's production API.  
For all requests, you MUST provide the following HTTP headers:

Header | Value
--- | ---
Accept | `application/vnd.busbud+json; version=2; profile=https://schema.busbud.com/v2/`
X-Busbud-Token | The token provided in the challenge invitation email.

### Init results

To get departure results, search is initialized via the following endpoint:

`https://napi.busbud.com/x-departures/:origin/:destination/:outbound_date`

PATH PARAMS  

- `origin` : Origin's geohash
- `destination` : Destination's geohash
- `outbound_date` : Outbound departure date, ISO 8061 date

QUERY PARAMS:

- `adult` : Number of adults
- `child` : Number of children
- `senior` : Number of seniors
- `lang` : ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 language code
- `currency` : ISO 4217 currency code

The response looks like:
```

  "origin_city_id": "375dd5879001acbd84a4683dedf9eed1",

### Poll results

**While "complete" is false, you need to call** :

`https://napi.busbud.com/x-departures/:origin/:destination/:outbound_date/poll`

With ***all*** the same parameters that the previous endpoint, plus:

`index` : Index from which to return new departures

The response is:
```
{
  "departures": [
    { XDeparture },
    { XDeparture }
  ],
  "operators": [
    { Operator },
    { Operator }
  ],
  "complete": true,
  "ttl": 900
}
```
